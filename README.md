# Analyzing-Crime-in-Los-Angeles 

## Project Description 
Los Angeles, California ðŸ˜Ž. The City of Angels. Tinseltown. The Entertainment Capital of the World! Known for its warm weather, palm trees, sprawling coastline, and Hollywood, along with producing some of the most iconic films and songs. However, as with any highly populated city, it isn't always glamorous and there can be a large volume of crime. 
This Data Analysis project aims to support the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) by analyzing crime data to identify patterns in criminal behavior. I need to find out the answers of several questions: 
  * Which hour has the highest frequency of crimes?
  * Which area has the largest frequency of night crimes (crimes committed between 10pm and 3:59am)?
  * Identify the number of crimes committed against victims of different age groups.

## The Data
They have provided a single dataset to use. A summary and preview are provided below.It is a modified version of the original data, which is publicly available from Los Angeles Open Data.
